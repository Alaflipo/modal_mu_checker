# modal_mu_checker
Modal mu calculus checker for the 2IMF35 course - Algorithms for model checking

To run this project execute main.py: 
usage: main.py [-h] [-lts LABELED_TRANSITION_SYSTEM] [-mcf MODAL_CALCULUS_FORMULA]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -lts LABELED_TRANSITION_SYSTEM, --labeled_transition_system LABELED_TRANSITION_SYSTEM
                        File path to the labeled transtion system file (in .aut format)
  -mcf MODAL_CALCULUS_FORMULA, --modal_calculus_formula MODAL_CALCULUS_FORMULA
                        File path to the mu calculus formula (in .mcf format)
